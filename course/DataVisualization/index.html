  I attended the course "Data Visualization" on Coursera, following is the assignments.

  <h1>Programming Assignment 1</h1>
This graph visualizes the GISTEM data for the Globe and the North and South Hemispheres through all the given years. The x Axis shows the year, and y Axis shows the temperature.<br>
The Orange line describes the data for the Northern Hemisphere, the Green line for the South Hemisphere, and the Blue line is for the Globe.<br>
We put the x axis on the 0 degree, so that we can see the temperature changes .<br>
a.The resulting graph shows an increasing mean Global Temperature over the years.<br>
b.We can also see the temperature of south hemisphere is lower than the globe in most of the years, while the north hemisphere is higher than the globe.<br>
c.The temperature changes significantly near zero degree from 1930 to 1980.<br>

  <h1>Programming Assignment 2</h1>
The dataset I use to draw the graph is <a href="https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data.php?id=5">"American College Football"</a>. It is an undirected graph with 115 nodes and 613 edges. The graph is not so large, even I use all the dataset, I can see the detail of each node.<br>
I use Gephi to visualize the data. Firstly, I use the modularity function to find the community in the graph. Then I encode the color of the node with different communities. The degree of nodes is encoded with  size of the node and label. I also find two edges with weight 2, whose size is larger than edges with weight 1.<br>
